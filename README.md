`moodle-dl` is a console application that can download all the files from your Moodle courses that are necessary for your daily study routine. Furthermore, moodle-dl can notify you about various activities on your Moodle server. Notifications can be sent to Discord, Telegram, XMPP and Mail. The current implementation includes: 

- Download files, assignments including submissions, forums, workshops, lessons, quizzes, descriptions, as well as external links.
- Notifications about all downloaded files
- Text from your Moodle courses (like pages, descriptions or forum-posts) will be directly attached to the notifications, so you can read them directly in your messaging app.
- A configuration wizard is also included, allowing all settings to be made very easily.
- Running moodle-dl again will only download files that have not been downloaded yet. Do not miss any files, if files are deleted online, they are still available offline.
- It is possible to download Moodle courses you are enrolled in, as well as courses that are publicly visible to you.

Development discussions happen on [Discord in the developer channel](https://discord.gg/HNg7CsqEnZ).

### Options
Options can be combined with all the actions mentioned above.
- `--path PATH`
    - This option can be useful if you want to save the downloaded files in a directory other than the current working directory (the directory where you run the script). 
    - Sets the location of the configuration, logs and downloaded files. 
    - `PATH` must be an existing directory in which you have read and write access.
    - Default: current working directory
- `--threads INT`
    - Overwrites the number of download threads. (default: 5)
- `--verbose`
    - Print various debugging information into the `MoodleDownloader.log` file.
- `--username USERNAME`
    - Can be used to automate the `--new-token` process. 
    - Specify username to skip the query when creating a new token.
- `--password PASSWORD`
    - Can be used to automate the `--new-token` process. 
    - Specify password to skip the query when creating a new token.
    - If the password contains special characters like spaces you can enclose it in quotation marks
- `--max-path-length-workaround`
    - If this flag is set, all path are made absolute in order to work around the max_path limitation on Windows.
    - To use relative paths on Windows you should [disable the max_path limitation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=cmd).
    - Default: False
- `--skip-cert-verify`
    - This flag is used to skip the certification verification while sending requests to Moodle and all other websites.
    - Warning: This might lead to security flaws and should only be used in non-production environments.
    - Default: False
- `--ignore-ytdl-errors`
    - If this option is set, errors that occur when downloading with the help of Youtube-dl are ignored. Thus, no further attempt will be made to download the file using youtube-dl. 
    - By default, youtube-dl errors are critical, so the download of the corresponding file will be aborted and when you run moodle-dl again, the download will be repeated.  
    - You can use this option if a download using youtube-dl fails repeatedly.
- `--without-downloading-files`
    - This flag is used to skip the downloading of files.
    - This allows the local database to be updated to the latest version of Moodle without having to download all files.
    - This can also be used to ignore recurring errors by adding the files that produce the errors to the database. So these files are not downloaded again.
- `--sso`
    - This flag is used to indicate that a Single Sign On (SSO) login to your Moodle is required. 
    - Can be combined with `--init` and `--new-token`.




### Notes
- Use a separate E-Mail/XMPP - Account for sending out the notifications, as its login data is saved in cleartext.
- The Login-Information for your Moodle-Account is secure, it isn't saved in any way. Only a Login-Token is saved.
- Your Moodle token is stored in the configuration file (`config.json`). Be careful that no unauthorized person reads this file, especially the token must not be given to an unauthorized person, this can cause a lot of trouble.
- The `privatetoken` can be used to create a cookie for your Moodle account. A Cookie is what is used to tell Moodle that you are logged in. The `cookie.txt` always keeps a valid cookie for you, take great care of this file, if it falls into the wrong hands someone can take over your entire Moodle account. This feature is only important for Moodles with plugins installed that are not supported by the Moodle app. If you do not want to generate cookies, remove the `privatetoken` from the `config.json`.
